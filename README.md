# Don't String Me Along 

Don't String Me Along is a coding challenge that is sometimes great and sometimes makes you wish you never met.

## Description

In this exercise you must will solve a number of challenges for dealing with manipulating and searching strings in various ways.

## Objectives

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub profile and clone to your local machine.

2. Write a function that finds the missing numbers in the following sequence of numbers "9899100101103104105".

3. Write a function that takes a string of two words as input such as a name and swaps the order of the words with a comma separating the two words. Ex. "Jay Won" => "Won, Jay" Bonus: Use RegEx to solve this problem

4. Write a function that takes 2 strings as input and tests if the first string can be found in a circular variation of the second string.

5. Write a function that takes a single word as input and tests if it is a palindrome (ex. racecar), the same forwards as backwards. Bonus: Test for the existence of any palindromes in a word
